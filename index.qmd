title: "R Intro (Winter 2026 / RSM358)"
---

R is an open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It has a large collection of high-quality user contributed packages that provides powerful tools for data analysis tasks. This 4-session workshop will introduce you the basics of R programming and data analysis so as to prepare you for the RSM358 coding assignments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What To Prepare

Please install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) before the first session.

If you encounter technical difficulties installing the software, you can instead use R and RStudio in the Cloud at the UofT JupyterHub. Simply go to its [landing page](https://datatools.utoronto.ca/) and choose the *RStudio* option. You will need your UTORid to login.
